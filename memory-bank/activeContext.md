# SubNetx Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- Initial memory bank setup for the SubNetx project
- Documentation of project architecture, patterns, and components
- Understanding current codebase organization and functionality

## Recent Changes
- Created memory bank documentation structure
- Documented project requirements and goals
- Established system architecture overview
- Captured technical context and dependencies

## Next Steps
- Verify Docker container build process
- Test VPN subnet creation and management
- Document metrics collection functionality
- Improve error handling in shell scripts
- Create comprehensive usage examples
- Consider implementing additional security features

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### 1. Environment Variable Configuration
Currently considering the appropriate default values for environment variables and whether additional configuration options should be added for advanced use cases.

### 2. Multi-Container Orchestration
Evaluating the current Docker Compose configuration for multi-VPN deployments and identifying potential improvements for resource allocation and network isolation.

### 3. Client Management
Reviewing the client certificate management process to ensure it follows security best practices and provides adequate user feedback.

### 4. Security Hardening
Considering additional security measures that could be implemented:
- Certificate revocation handling
- Enhanced firewall rules
- Automated security auditing

### 5. Documentation
Planning improvements to user documentation:
- More detailed deployment examples
- Troubleshooting guides
- Advanced configuration scenarios

## Current Status
The project provides a functional OpenVPN container solution with basic management capabilities, but there are opportunities for enhancement in security, usability, and documentation.

## Implementation Notes
- Shell scripts should be reviewed for error handling robustness
- Interactive terminal interface works well but could benefit from improved user feedback
- Certificate management follows standard OpenVPN practices
- Docker implementation provides good isolation for VPN instances
