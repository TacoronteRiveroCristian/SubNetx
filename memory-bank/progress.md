# SubNetx Progress Tracker

## What Works
- **Docker Container**: Ubuntu 22.04 base with all required dependencies
- **OpenVPN Setup**: Basic server configuration and initialization
- **Certificate Management**: Generation and management of server/client certificates
- **Client Configuration**: Creation of .ovpn files for clients
- **Network Configuration**: NAT and routing for VPN clients
- **Interactive Terminal**: Command-line interface for VPN management
- **Docker Compose**: Multi-container orchestration support
- **Environment Variables**: Configuration through external parameters

## What's Left to Build
- **Metrics Collection**: Implementation of VPN usage metrics
- **Advanced Security Features**: Certificate revocation list management
- **Extended Documentation**: Comprehensive user guides and examples
- **Automated Testing**: Test suite for configuration validation
- **Error Handling Improvements**: More robust error handling in scripts
- **Log Management**: Better logging for troubleshooting

## Current Status
The project provides a functional OpenVPN container with basic configuration and management capabilities. Core features are implemented and working, but there are opportunities for enhancement and refinement.

### Completed Components
- Basic OpenVPN server setup and configuration
- Client certificate generation and management
- Network routing and NAT configuration
